# Hi, I'm Jordan

I'm a full stack developer/engineer/designer/UX/UI-type-person with a focus on JAM, MERN, and Python/Ruby based stacks. I also dabble in C (C99 and C11), Go, Zig, and Rust to the tune of systems programming, and hacking OSS tooling for fun or for want.

I'm also a long-time player in the crypto scene (specifically blockchain although my cryptography-proper is coming along in terms of hard mathematical understanding too), so I enjoy building for Web3 and writing things in Solidity.

Finally, I would describe myself as a "learns it" kind of guy. I am not attached to any one tool or methodoloy, I adapt the best tool for the job and if that means I have to learn something new I roll my sleeves up with excitement.

Drop a line and say hi if you like!
